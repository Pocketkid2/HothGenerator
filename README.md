A Bukkit/Spigot/Paper world generator for Star Wars worlds like Hoth, Tatooine, Dagobah, and Mustafar!

Forked and revised from the original hothgenerator plugin which is now abandoned.

From the original plugin readme: This generator will produce an icy world with a thick ice and snow layer and the occational snow
covered mountain. Hidden below you might find tiny caves where life that once inhabited the surface
still surviving and perhaps you'll find strange structures left over from some ancient civilization.
